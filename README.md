# Gems experiment

## Research question

Can individuals pass on knowledge via language that enables future generations
to exceed previous generations?

## Methods

### Procedure

On each trial, participants see 6 gabor patches ("gems") that vary in
orientation and bar width and they select the one they think is most valuable.

Unbeknownst to the participants, the 6 gabors they see on each trial
are sampled from within a certain radius in stimulus space of their last
trial.

Participants are assigned to Generation 1 or Generation 2.

- Generation 1 participants complete 2 blocks, then they type out instructions
  for the next generation, then they complete 2 more blocks.
- Generation 2 participants read the instructions from Generation 1, then
  complete 4 blocks.

## Analyses

1. How does the performance of Generation 1 participants in blocks 1 and 2
   compare to the performance of Generation 2 participants in blocks 1 and 2?
2. How does the performance of Generation 1 participants in blocks 3 and 4
   compare to the performance of Generation 2 participants in blocks 1 and 2?
