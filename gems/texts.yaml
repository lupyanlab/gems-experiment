  Congratulations! You are a space explorer who has just arrived on Planet Teeb. You are here to collect precious gems. Some examples of the gems found on Planet Teeb are shown below.

generation_instructions:
  generation_1: |
    You are the first person to ever set foot on Planet Teeb. There is no one who can teach you which gems are worth more than the others. You have to figure out on your own through trial-and-error learning which gems are the most valuable.
  generation_N: |
    You are not the first person to come to Planet Teeb looking for precious gems. On a later screen, you will receive instructions from a previous explorer who has learned through trial-and-error which gems are the most valuable.
example_trial_title: Here is how you will collect gems
example_trial: |
  To collect precious gems, you will be presented 6 gems at a time, as shown below. You will select one of them that you think is most valuable, and you will learn the value of the gem you select. Your goal is to try to pick more and more valuable gems on each trial so that you get the highest total score in the game.

  Press the SPACEBAR to continue.

foreshadow_title: Think about your strategy
foreshadow: |
  After you have collected gems for a while, you will be asked to write down how to select the most valuable gems for the next explorer who arrives on Planet Teeb. As you are collecting gems, be thinking of what you could tell another explorer that would help them select the most valuable gems on each trial. Try testing different strategies for picking precious gems so that you can be the most helpful when leaving instructions for the next generation.
