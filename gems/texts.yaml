  You are here to collect precious gems.
welcome_text: |
  Congratulations! You are a space explorer who has just arrived on Planet Teeb. You are here to collect precious gems. Some examples of the gems found on Planet Teeb are shown below. One of these gems is worth more than the others. Your goal in this experiment is to learn which gems are worth more than the others.

generation_instructions:
  generation_1: |
    You are the first person to ever set foot on Planet Teeb. There is no one who can teach you which gems are worth more than the others. You have to figure out on your own and through trial-and-error which gems are the most valuable.
  generation_N: |
    You are not the first person to come to Planet Teeb looking for previous gems. When you arrive, you seek out someone to teach you which gems are worth more than others. On the next screen, you will receive instructions from a previous explorer who has learned through trial-and-error which gems are the most valuable.

  Instructions from the previous explorer

  Here are the instructions you received from the explorer who was here before you. Read these instructions carefully as they will help you select the most valuable gems.

pre_test_title: Are you ready to collect gems?
pre_test: |
  Now you will strike out on your own and collect gems at 4 different quarries all over Planet Teeb. You will only learn the value of the gem you select, and not the values of the gems you do not select. Try to learn through trial-and-error which gems are the most valuable. Your goal is try to select the most valuable gem on each trial and get the highest total score.

  After you have collected gems for a while, you will be asked to write instructions for the next explorer who arrives on Planet Teeb after you. As you collect gems, be thinking of what you could tell the next generation that would help them select the most valuable gems. Try different strategies for picking gems so that you can be the most helpful when leaving instructions for the next generation.

  If you are confused about the task, or have a question you would like to ask the researcher, please do so now. When you are ready to begin collecting gems at the first quarry, press the SPACEBAR.
