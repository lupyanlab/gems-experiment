At first the circles or gems aren't going to make sense at all and it really seems like you're just picking at random. Eventually, the lines start to form a moving image of lines of different sizes. The inside of the gem and lines are either white or black and still or moving. To choose the correct gem, I started to choose the lines that were both moving in the same direction, but the gem itself was opposite. All of the moving lines seem similar at first as well, but the longer you stare at them the more clear they become.
