The gems went up in value when the lines became more horizontal.  Also, the amount of lines matters. More lines is good, but don't let the lines get too small where the top and bottom of the gem are no longer black otherwise the gems go down in value. Also, more defined lines on the gems usuallly make them more valuable.
