The value of each gem seems to correlate with how it compares to the previous gem. For example, a positive value was given to a majority of gems that had lines slightly more horizontal than the last. Selecting a gem whose lines were more horizontal than the last has something to do with the value. I didnt find any correlations between number of line and thickness, however as the linqes got more and more horizontal the gems had a higher number of lines.
