The spacing between the stripes is something to pay attention to. As the spacing gets smaller, look for how straight the stripes are and that will help with improving the value of the gems. There seems to be no pattern observable to which color stripe should go first and as the thickness gets smaller it becomes very less clear which gems are more valuable. There does seem to be a pattern to look for that has to do with the angle that the stripes are in as you progress but I couldn't figure it out.
