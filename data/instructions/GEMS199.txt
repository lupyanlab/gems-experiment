I noticed that the gems I selected were rotated in a certain way. When you first start out, the lines on the gems will be going up and down. From there, you'll want to pick the gem that is turned more clockwise. Gem after gem, you'll want to pick which one is turned the most clockwise. When that method seems to not work anymore, choose the gems that are turned more counterclockwise and go from there.
