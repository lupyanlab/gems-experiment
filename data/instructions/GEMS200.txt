I dont really know what makes certain gems more valuable than others.  I just ended up picking random gems each time trying to find correlations.  Over time it seemed like those with very small lines and very large, fat lines tended to result in negative values.  So I tried picking the gems with medium line thickness to see if that worked which it did some of the time.  I also tried to see if there was a pattern in what order you picked them and was unable to come up with concrete solution that garauntees a positive value.  In the end it seemed to be just a random crap shoot on which gems were more valuable than others as they all look fairly similar.
