Honestly, I did not really catch onto what makes certain gems worth more than the other gems. Some thoughts I had was maybe the strips of the previous gem selected had some correlation to the worth of the next gem. I also thought maybe the overall position if it was 1st,2nd,3rd,etc. might have had something to do with it, but none of these theories I had was backed with any evidence from the game.
