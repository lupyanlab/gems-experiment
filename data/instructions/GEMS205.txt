You will think that the gems all look the same. As you progress, the lines become more focused and thinner. Keep picking the one with the most lines. One that has less lines that the previous one will give you negative points. One exactly the same will give you zero points. Once the lines are pretty small, start to look at the angle of them. An angle that isn't the same but not totally different is a good one to pick.
