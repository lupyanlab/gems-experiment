the way i was able to decide which gems were more valuable was by the way they look compared to the others. i first started out seeing which ones would stand out from the rest of the gems. but, once i saw that the number of lines varied i decided to look and see which had more lnes in respective to the rest. lastly, i also looked at the colors. the ones with more vivid colors i would pick over tye more blurry colored ones.
