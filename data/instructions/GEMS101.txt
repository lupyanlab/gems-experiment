Try to pick the correct color endings at the edge of the circle horizontally. So, if the ending is black on the edges, then pick black edges for the next two rounds. The lines should be clear as well, instead of being blurry.If it is white ending on the edge do the same. More lines doesn't mean more valuable. Instructions may vary. This is a basic hypothesis that can be falsiable.
