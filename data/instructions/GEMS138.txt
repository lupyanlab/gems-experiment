I found that picking gems most similar to the gem presented got me the most points. However, when I picked the gem that was identical to the gem presented, a majority of the time I got zero points. I also tried to see if the number of lines and thickness of lines make the gems more valuable. I found that more lines usually means the gem is more valuable. I did not find anything important regarding the thickness of the lines.
