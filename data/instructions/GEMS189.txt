I think that the size of the stripes, the thickness of the black and white stripes, and how zoomed in or out the gem is are determinants of what makes some gems more valuable than others. Also, at the end, I started to notice how if I collected a gem with a white line on the top, another valuable gem would be black on the top. Also, I realized that if a gem looks like the one you previously collect, it is mostly worth 0 points.
