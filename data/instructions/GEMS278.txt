It was very difficult for me to figure out what makes some gems more valuable than others and I'm still not quite sure. I think that it might have to do with the number of lines and also the amount of white spaces versus black spaces. If a gem has white on the exterior or touching the outer parts of the shape, I believe that it is more valuable. Also, the larger amount of total lines, the more valuable the gem.
