The gems that seem to be worth more are either ones with more lines on them or ones with thicker lines. Check all of the gems in the set and if there is one that seems to have a lot more lines or a much thicker lines, then choose it. Use the value of the gems you pick to decide whether a similar gem is a good choice.
