the gems have different sizes, number, and width of stripes. Avoid the ones with 9 or 13 stripes and make sure to include the stripes at the very end. try to pay attention the angle of the stripes as well. commit to memory what the gems with high scores and low scores look like and test your doubts. good luck uwu
